What Is a Hydration Error?
    - The HTML generated on the server does NOT match what React renders in the browser.

    Common Causes of Hydration Errors:
        - Math.random()
        - Date.now()
        - Using window during render
        - Different conditional rendering between server & client
        - Browser-only APIs during SSR
