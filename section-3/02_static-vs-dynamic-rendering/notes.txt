    SSG – Static Site Generation) - HTML is generated at build time (when you run next build) and reused for every request.

        - During build
        - Not on every user request

    Static with Revalidation (ISR) - 
        - You can regenerate the page after some time: This is called Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR).
    
    Dynamic Rendering (SSR – Server Side Rendering)
        - HTML is generated on every request.
    When it happens:
        - Every time a user visits the page
